## Partnership Opportunities

Actively seeking investors and developing strategic partnerships in two models:

**Embedded Solutions**
Organizations embedding our offline AI, 3D CAD kernel, and digital twin technology into their products and platforms. Self-sovereign architecture simplifies compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2) and reduces security risks by eliminating cloud dependencies. Ideal for companies building industrial automation systems, IoT platforms, manufacturing software, or engineering tools who want to offer cutting-edge capabilities without cloud dependencies.

**SaaS Deployments**
Organizations adopting our complete platform as-is for their teams and workflows. Offline-first design ensures data sovereignty and simplified compliance frameworks. Perfect for manufacturers, design firms, engineering departments, and enterprises seeking turnkey solutions with full control over their data.
