# jj - Jujutsu Version Control System

This directory contains tooling for installing and managing **Jujutsu (jj)** and **jjui** - modern version control tools that provide a Git-compatible but more intuitive workflow.

Jujutsu is a Git-compatible DVCS with automatic rebase, conflict-free merging, and powerful revset queries that simplifies complex Git workflows. The jjui tool provides a terminal user interface (TUI) for interactive commit history and visual branching.

Both tools are automatically downloaded and managed using the `jj-taskfile.yml` with smart caching and cross-platform support. See the [jj repository](https://github.com/jj-vcs/jj) and [jjui repository](https://github.com/idursun/jjui) for more details.
